      "text": "Task: Transform this amateur product photograph into a premium, professional e-commerce studio shot. Goal: The product must look pristine and high-quality, while maintaining pixel-perfect fidelity to all original text and branding details. 1. Background & Isolation: Isolate the product perfectly from the floor background. Place it on a seamless, pure white background (#FFFFFF). 2. General Surface Enhancement (Non-Text Areas): On the main fabric and materials *only*, gently smooth out unsightly wrinkles, creases, and remove dust or dirt to create a flawless, new appearance. Ensure materials look premium. 3. CRITICAL: Extreme Text and Label Preservation (PROTECTED ZONES): The model MUST NOT apply any smoothing, denoising, blurring, or 'cleaning' effects to areas containing text, logos, or small labels. All alphanumeric text, branding details (like 'NIKE GRIPKNIT'), sizing tags, and fine print must remain incredibly SHARP, CRISP, and LEGIBLE. Treat these areas as protected high-fidelity zones. It is better to leave a tiny imperfection near text than to blur the text itself. The text must be identical to the source image, just cleaner. 4. Perspective & Lighting: Strictly maintain the exact camera angle and perspective seen in the input image. Do not rotate or tilt the object. Replace the amateur lighting with professional, soft, even studio lighting that defines the form. Add a subtle, realistic contact shadow on the white floor so the product does not look like it is floating. 5. Framing: Center the product fully within the frame with balanced white space."

      "text": "Task: High-Fidelity Background Replacement & Studio Lighting Composition. Goal: Isolate the product EXACTLY as it appears in the source image onto a white background. 1. Background: Seamless pure white (#FFFFFF). Add a natural, soft contact shadow to ground the object. 2. Source Fidelity (CRITICAL): Do NOT 'regenerate', 'repaint', or 'smooth' the product texture. The goal is to preserve the authentic reality of the item, not to create a 3D render. Keep the original fabric texture and material definition exactly as provided in the input. 3. Text Protection: The text, logos, and labels (e.g., 'NIKE GRIPKNIT', size tags) must be preserved pixel-for-pixel from the original. Do not apply any denoising or beautification filters to text areas. They must remain sharp and readable. 4. Lighting: Adjust only the global exposure and contrast to match a professional studio look. Do not alter the local shadows or highlights on the shoe itself to ensure the design remains 100% accurate. 5. Framing: Center the product with balanced white space."

      "text": "Task: Technical Background Replacement & Color Correction ONLY. Goal: Isolate the product exactly as it appears in the source image onto a white background. 1. STRICT OBJECT PRESERVATION (CRITICAL): Do NOT redraw, re-render, repaint, or 'clean' the product structure. The pixels constituting the shoes (fabric texture, laces, and especially TEXT/LOGOS) must remain identical to the source image. Do not attempt to fix wrinkles or texture if it risks altering the text. Authenticity is the priority over 'perfect' smoothness. 2. Text & Label Integrity: Absolutely NO smoothing, blurring, or changing of text areas (e.g., 'NIKE GRIPKNIT', tags). Treat the product as a 'protected layer' that cannot be modified, only brightened. 3. Background: Replace the floor with seamless pure white (#FFFFFF). 4. Lighting Adjustment: Apply GLOBAL brightness and contrast adjustments only to match studio standards. Do not change the lighting direction or cast new shadows on the shoe structure itself. 5. Output: The result should look like the original photo was skillfully cut out and placed on white, NOT like a 3D render or a generated image."
